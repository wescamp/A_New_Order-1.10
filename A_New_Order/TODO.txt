Old ToDos for porting to 1.8 (written by tapik?)
------------------------
*minimize Oracle unit definition, she could not be anyhow recruited (infinity cost, zero movement, stone,...?)
*improve maps
*fix image paths
*do workarounds when an appropriate image misses (e.g. attack sprites)
   *attack end>60
*add graphics for units
*Battle of Barnon:
   *ensure Gawen death - bunch of 3level units from turn 10, unlimitid number of turns
   *Gawen could'n go far from the fortress

# units speaking in his/her death event
# unknown scenarios referred to by id
# macro references in translatable strings

# missing whitespaces in message macro calls
# removed undefined ELVISH_RECRUIT (first appearance in ANO for Wesnoth 1.4)
 syncing recruit= and recruitment_pattern=
# e.g. "Orcish Archer (archer) doesn't match the recruitment pattern (fighter, fighter, healer, fighter) for its side"
# e.g. "no healer units recruitable at difficulty NORMAL"
… *lots* of changes
… But more investigation is needed:
What was the original intention and what is best for balancing? Fix recruit= or recruitment_pattern= or both?

- unit definitions
# unknown advancements
Orcish Shaman has unknown advancements ['Orcish Witch Doctor', 'Orcish Warlock'] <- should be replaced by unit from Son of the Black Eye (Novice Orcish Shaman (HP+1, melee+1) or Orcish Shaman(ranged+1(*2)))
# missing unit
Shadow_Mage <- Shadow Mage copied from Liberty
