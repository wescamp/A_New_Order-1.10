This is my personal list of what I'd love to have. If you 
are artist and want to contribute, please look at this list and think whether
you could do these portraits. You can also hire someone to do them, or 
sent me 20-40 euros and I will pay my artist to do them.

They are sorted in order of importance.  In addition, you may consider making
animations for sprites, or correct existing sprites.

PORTRAITS
---------
* Grekulak
* Generic "bad" Akladian lord (could be used for Uri van Roe and others)
* Hagarthen kings: Luc, Buffin, Gauri (one generic king is enough)
* Generic "good" Akladian high level unit (e.g. Protector, Shieldguard, maybe 
  also Fastfoot)
* Generic "bad" Akladian high level unit (e.g. Darknite, Sturmknight)
* "Broken" Ruvio, after fall of freetown (preferrably bought from Santiago Iborra,
  if we will find the funds which seems unlikely..)
* Generic low-level Akladian unit with swords (Raiders+Homeguard, 
* Generic Akladian unit with spears (Pikeneer, Warrior, Clansman, LightInfantry)
